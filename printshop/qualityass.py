Evaluate the quality and print readiness of this image based on the following criteria:

1. **Resolution and DPI:** Is the image high enough in resolution (ideally 300 DPI) for professional printing? Does it meet the size requirements for the intended print medium (e.g., poster, banner, business card)?
2. **Sharpness:** Is the image sharp and clear, with no noticeable blur? Consider how well the image will hold up when printed at various sizes.
3. **Color Accuracy and Consistency:** Is the image in the correct color space (e.g., CMYK for printing)? Are the colors accurate, consistent, and without noticeable color shifts?
4. **File Format:** Is the image in a suitable format for printing (e.g., TIFF, PNG, high-resolution JPEG)? Are there any compression artifacts or other file-related issues that could degrade print quality?
5. **Cropping and Composition:** Is the image well-cropped with a balanced composition? Will important elements be preserved in the printed version without awkward cuts?
6. **Noise and Artifacts:** Is the image free from excessive noise, grain, or other visual artifacts that could negatively affect the print quality?

Based on these criteria, classify the image as "Print Ready" or "Needs Improvement" and provide a brief explanation for your decision.
